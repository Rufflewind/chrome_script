Custom Stylesheet & Script
==========================

This is simple extension that inserts custom JavaScript and CSS code into each
web page, allowing you to modify the way it behaves and looks.

Download/installation
---------------------

You can download and install directly from the [Google Chrome webstore][1].

Usage
-----

The default installation does nothing.  You'll have to provide the script and
stylesheet yourself.

To edit the script and stylesheet, go to *chrome://extensions* and click
*Options* under *Custom Stylesheet & Script*.

The text areas in the *Options* tab will automatically save as you edit.
Existing pages are not affected until refreshed.

Note: jQuery is no longer included and cannot be used in the custom script
anymore.
